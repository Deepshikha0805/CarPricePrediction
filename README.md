# CarPricePrediction

In my car price prediction project, I use smart computer programs to guess how much a car might cost. The programs look at things like the car's brand, model, year it was made, how far it has been driven, and any extra features it has. With all this information, the programs can make a good guess about how much the car is worth. The goal of this project is to help people who want to buy or sell a car make smart choices based on accurate price predictions.
